# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project was requested by a school district to gain insights for school metrics involving school size, school type and budget.  The district asked us to look at: 
- Math and Reading Scores
- Math and Reading Pass rates
- Overall passing rates (math + reading)
- Scores and Pass rates grouped by school type (charter vs district)
- Scores and pass rates grouped by per student spending (<$586, $586-630, $631-645, $646-675)
- Scores and pass rates grouped by school size (<1000, 1000-1999, 2000-5000)
